            <h2>Tips on how to properly care for your cat</h2>
            <p>Proper cat care includes feeding, grooming, and ensuring they get enough playtime and mental stimulation. However feeding is not something to be taken lightly. Nowadays, pet food is extremely processed, laced with graind and cereals which a cat's body cannot digest properly. Most cats survive better on a raw fed diet rather than on dry food or canned food. </p>

            <p>When it comes to bathing a cat or grooming it, we must be extra careful as most of the products can be harmful. Shampoos for cats should be scent free and with a simpler ingredient list as possible as a cat's skin is highly sensitive.</p>
               
            <p>Playtime and mental stimulation are very important. It is essential that a cat has adequate space in order to roam around freely and play too. A cat tree is a good acquisition in such cases as it usually comes with a scratching pole in order for them to groom their own claws. It is also useful for climbing and jumping on and from it. Stimulating toys such as foil filled toys are very good for the cat as its sounds increase their excitement. It is also imperative that the cat's owner spends enough time with them in order for them to not feel lonely. Believe it or not, cats feel lonely too sometimes!
